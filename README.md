This work is focused on collecting, analyzing, and visualizing weather data from various cities. 

WeatherPy.ipynb emphasizes data collection, preparation, and visualization through scatter plots and linear regression analysis. It culminates in exporting the cleaned data.
It includes correlation analysis between latitude and weather (max. temperature, humidity, wind speed)

VacationPy.ipynb builds upon this by loading the exported data, creating a detailed map visualization, and enhancing it with additional features like hotel search results. The use of APIs, data normalization, and comprehensive plotting are key aspects of the analysis and presentation in both notebooks.
